    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    
    <!-- this paragraph describes the prupse of why Dry Oar rafting trours needs a website -->
    <p>Dry Oar Rafting is seeking a Website in order to get more customers. It is our hope that the website should rovide everything a customer needs to know about Dry Oar Rafting and its services. This includes but is not limited to: information about the company and its services, including our multiple rafting options: Day trips, adventure weeks, and water safety trainings. An option for clients to book and pay for trips. The site should provide all the paper work that a client would need prior to going on their trip; such as waivers. The site should also provide Testimonials from past customers to help potential customers know what fun and excitement awaits them. I would also like ther to be information on how a clinet could contact us.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>I expect that my website will apeal to my audience. I get reagular foot trafic at our local store, but we are hoping to expand and bring in more serious adventures than the tourists who frequent our shop. My customers want an exciting trip that has everything setup. I expect them to be adventure seekers but many of them will not have their own equipment. They will be someone who is looking for a turn key solution. They will access the site from multipe devices. Younger CLients will probably use mobile devices where as older clients will likley use a desktop computer as they sit at work, not realy working but day dreaming about their next adventure.
